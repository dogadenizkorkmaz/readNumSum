# File Operations in Java

This Java program demonstrates basic file operations, including creating a file, writing data to it, and reading data from it.

## Description

The program performs the following operations:

1. Creates a file named `data.txt` in the `src` directory.
2. Writes the data provided in the `data` array to the file. Each data item is written on a new line.
3. Reads the numbers from the file and calculates their total.
4. Prints the total of the numbers read from the file.

## File Structure

- `Main.java`: Java source code file containing the main program.
- `src/data.txt`: Text file where data is written and read.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Run the `Main.java` file to execute the program.
4. The program will create the `data.txt` file, write data to it, read the data, and print the total of the numbers read from the file.
